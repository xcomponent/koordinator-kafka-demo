# Koordinator Kafka Demo

This repository demos the use of Koordinator to integrate batch and stream
based jobs. In this example, we have a batch job `image-search`, that given some
search terms generate a list of urls of images matching the terms; and
`download-image`, a Kafka producer/consumer written in Java that allows one to
download the images in parallel.

## Requirements

* A Kafka broker, in our tests we use [this](https://hub.docker.com/r/spotify/kafka/) docker container
* Set the variables `WORKER_USERNAME` and `WORKER_PASSWORD` as your credentials
  in the Koordinator server, and `KOORDINATOR_URL` as the url of your server.

## Build

1. Install the dependencies of the `image-search` worker: `cd image-search && yarn install && cd ..`
2. Build the `download-image` worker: `cd download-image && ./build.sh && cd ..`

## Run

Just run the script `./test.sh`. It will start the workers and the workflow.
You should be able to monitor its execution in the Koordinator frontend.
